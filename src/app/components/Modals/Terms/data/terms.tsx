      <br />
      <p>
        From time to time and at any time, the Terms may be changed, amended, or
        revised without notice or consultation. If you do not agree to the
        revised Terms, then you should not continue to access or use the

      <br />
      <h4 className="font-bold text-primary">
        1. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement
      </h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way
        to the Interface or these Terms, you must send an email to{" "}
        <a href="mailto:contracts@babylonchain.io" className="text-primary">
          contracts@babylonchain.io
        </a>{" "}
        to resolve the matter via an informal, good faith negotiation process.
        If that dispute or claim is not resolved within 60 days of sending such
        an email, then you agree that all unresolved disputes or claims shall be
        finally and exclusively settled by arbitration under the LCIA
        Arbitration Rules in force at the time of the filing for arbitration of
        such dispute. The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator
        and shall be conducted in the English language on a confidential basis.
        The arbitration will be held in the Cayman Islands. Any award made by
        the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction as
        necessary. This section shall survive termination of these Terms, the
        Interface, the Website, or any connection you may have to the
        information you obtained from the Interface.

      <br />
      <h4 className="font-bold text-primary">
        2. Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver
      </h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        You agree to bring all disputes or claims connected to the Interface or
        the Website in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff in or
        member of any class action, collective action, private attorney general
        action, or other representative proceeding. Further, you irrevocably
        waive the right to demand a trial by jury.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4 className="font-bold text-primary">3. Governing Law</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        You agree that the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to the
        principles of conflict of laws, govern these Terms.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4 className="font-bold text-primary">4. About the Interface</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Interface aggregates and publishes publicly available third-party
        information.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Interface also offers interaction methods whereby the User can
        indicate a transaction that the User would like to perform in connection
        with the publicly available Babylon staking protocols (the{" "}
        <i className="text-primary">“Protocols”</i>). The interaction methods
        include accessing the functionalities of publicly deployed Protocol for
        Users to self-authorize token transfers on relevant blockchains.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4 className="font-bold text-primary">5. About the Protocol</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Protocols are software source codes freely licensed to the public
        under the license(s) identified in the applicable GitHub repository.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4 className="font-bold text-primary">
        6. Interface relationship to Protocol
      </h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        Using the relevant blockchain systems, third-party supplied wallets,
        devices, validator nodes or the Protocol does not require use of this
        Interface. Anyone with an internet connection can connect directly to
        the Protocol or blockchain without accessing or using the Interface.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Interface maintainers do not own, operate or control the blockchain
        systems, wallets or devices, validator nodes, or the Protocol.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Interface aggregates and publishes publicly available information
        about the Protocol in a user-friendly and convenient format. Such
        information is also independently available from other sources—for
        example, a User may directly review the blockchain transaction history,
        account balances, and compatible block explorers on each relevant
        blockchain. Users may also access code repositories for the various
        Protocols on platforms like Github.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        By combining publicly available information with the User’s interactions
        with the Interface, the Interface can draft standard transaction
        messages compatible with the Protocol. Standard transaction messages are
        designed to accomplish the User’s operational goals as expressed through
        the interactions. If the User wishes, they may broadcast such messages
        to the Bitcoin blockchain in order to initiate native Bitcoin staking.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        All draft transaction messages are delivered by the web Interface via an
        API to a compatible third-party wallet application or device selected by
        the User after pressing the{" "}
        <span className="text-primary">“Connect Wallet”</span> (or similar)
        button on the Interface.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The User must personally review and authorize all transaction messages
        that the User wishes to send to blockchain systems; this requires the
        User to sign the relevant transaction message with a private
        cryptographic key inaccessible to the Interface or the Interface
        maintainers, or Interface contributors. The use of such associated
        private cryptographic keys is beyond the control of the Interface, the
        Interface maintainers, or contributors.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The User-authorised message will then be broadcasted to blockchain
        systems through the wallet application or device and the User may pay a
        network fee to have the transaction message delivered through the
        Protocol and record the results on the appropriate blockchain—resulting
        in a token transaction being completed on that blockchain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Interface maintainers and the Interface are not agents or
        intermediaries of the User. The Interface or the Interface maintainers
        do not store, have access to or control over any tokens, private keys,
        passwords, accounts or other property of the User. The Interface or the
        Interface maintainers are not capable of performing transactions or
        sending transaction messages on behalf of the User. The Interface or the
        Interface maintainers do not hold and cannot purchase, sell or trade any
        tokens. All transactions relating to the Protocol are executed and
        recorded solely through the User’s interactions with the respective
        blockchains. The interactions are not under the control of or affiliated
        with the Interface maintainers or the Interface. The Interface
        maintainers do not collect any compensation from the User for use of the
        Interface.

        business plan, and may become unable or unwilling to fund the
        operational costs of the Interface on a long-term basis or to fund the
        upgrade costs required to keep the Interface up to date with current and
        upcoming technologies.

        The Interface is a free web application maintained at the sole and
        absolute discretion of a community of contributors who may also be known
        as <span className="text-primary">Interface maintainers</span>.
        Individually and collectively they assume no duty, liability,
        obligation, or undertaking to continue to maintain, or to make available
        the Interface. The Interface maintainers may terminate or change the
        Interface with respect to any aspect of the Interface at any time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Interface maintainers have no obligation, duty, or liability to
        ensure that the Interface is a complete and accurate source of all
        information relating to the Protocol or any other subject matter. Even
        if the Interface currently displays information about a particular token
        or blockchain, the Interface may discontinue tracking and publishing
        information about that token or blockchain at any time in the Interface
        maintainers&apos; sole and absolute discretion. In the event of such
        discontinuation, Users may need to rely on third-party resources such as
        block explorers or validator nodes in order to get equivalent
        information, and, depending on the User’s level of expertise and the
        quality of such third-party resources, this may result in the User
        incurring damages due to delays or mistakes in processing information or
        transactions.

      <h5 className="text-primary">11.2 No Regulatory Supervision</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Interface maintainers and the Interface are not registered or
        qualified with or licensed by, do not report to, and are not under the
        active supervision of any government agency or financial regulatory
        authority or organization. No government or regulator has approved or
        has been consulted by the Interface maintainers regarding the accuracy
        or completeness of any information available on the Interface.
        Similarly, the technology, systems, blockchains, tokens, and persons
        relevant to information published on the Interface may not be registered
        with or under the supervision of or be registered or qualified with or
        licensed by any government agency or financial regulatory authority or

      <br />
      <h5 className="text-primary">11.3 Regulatory Uncertainty</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        Blockchain technologies and digital assets are subject to many legal and
        regulatory uncertainties, and the Protocol or any tokens or blockchains
        could be adversely impacted by one or more regulatory or legal
        inquiries, actions, suits, investigations, claims, fines, or judgments,
        which could impede or limit the ability of User to continue the use and
        enjoyment of such assets and technologies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5 className="text-primary">11.4 No Warranty</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Interface is provided on an <i className="text-primary">“AS IS”</i>{" "}
        and <i className="text-primary">“AS AVAILABLE”</i> basis. You
        acknowledge and agree that your access and use of the Interface are at
        your own risk. There is no representation or warranty that access to the
        Interface will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or secure; that the
        information contained in the Interface will be accurate, reliable,
        complete, or current, or that the Interface will be free from errors,
        defects, viruses, or other harmful elements. No advice, information, or
        statement made in connection with the Interface should be treated as
        creating any warranty concerning the Interface. There is no endorsement,
        guarantee, or assumption of responsibility for any advertisements,
        offers, or statements made by third parties concerning the Interface.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Further, there is no representation or warranty, from anyone, as to the
        quality, origin, or ownership of any content found on or available
        through the Interface and there shall be no liability for any errors,
        misrepresentations, or omissions in, of, and about, the content, nor for
        the availability of the content attributable to any contributor to the
        Interface, including maintainers, and they shall not be liable for any
        losses, injuries, or damages from the use, inability to use, or the
        display of the content of the Interface.

        11.5 Token Lists and Token Identification
      </h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        In providing information about tokens, the Interface associates or
        presumes the association of a token name, symbol, or logo with a
        specific smart contract deployed to one or more blockchain systems. In
        making such associations, the Interface relies upon third-party
        resources which may not be accurate or may not conform to a given User’s
        expectations. Multiple smart contracts can utilize the same token name
        or token symbol as one another, meaning that the name or symbol of a
        token does not guarantee that it is the token desired by the User or
        generally associated with such name or symbol. Users must not rely on
        the name, symbol, or branding of a token on the Interface, but instead
        must examine the specific smart contract associated with the name,
        symbol, or branding and confirm that the token accords with User’s
        expectations.

        11.7 No Interface Fees; Third-Party Fees Irreversible
      </h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are no fees or charges for use of the Interface. Use of the

        References, links, or referrals to or connections with or reliance on
        third-party resources, products, services, or content, including smart
        contracts developed or operated by third parties, may be provided to

      <h5 className="text-primary">15.2 Cryptography Risks</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or
        technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may
        present risks to blockchain systems, the Protocol, or tokens, including
        the theft, loss, or inaccessibility thereof.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5 className="text-primary">15.3 Fork Handling</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Protocol, and all tokens may be subject to{" "}
        <span className="text-primary">Forks</span>. Forks occur when some or
        all persons running the software clients for a particular blockchain
        system adopt a new client or a new version of an existing client that:
        (i) changes the protocol rules in backward-compatible or
        backward-incompatible manner that affects which transactions can be
        added into later blocks, how later blocks are added to the blockchain,
        or other matters relating to the future operation of the protocol; or
        (ii) reorganizes or changes past blocks to alter the history of the
        blockchain. Some forks are{" "}
        <span className="text-primary">“contentious”</span> and thus may result
        in two or more persistent alternative versions of the protocol or
        blockchain, either of which may be viewed as or claimed to be the
        legitimate or genuine continuation of the original.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Interface maintainers cannot anticipate, control or influence the
        occurrence or outcome of forks, and do not assume any risk, liability or
        obligation in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of
        the foregoing, Interface maintainers do not assume any responsibility to
        notify a User of pending, threatened or completed forks. Interface
        maintainers will respond (or refrain from responding) to any forks in
        such manner as Interface maintainers determine in their sole and
        absolute discretion. Interface maintainers shall not have any duty or
        obligation, or liability to a User if such response (or lack of such
        response) acts to a User’s detriment. Each User assumes full
        responsibility to independently remain apprised of and informed about
        possible forks, and to manage the User’s own interests and risks in
        connection therewith.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5 className="text-primary">
        15.4 Essential Third-Party Software Dependencies
      </h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Protocol and other relevant blockchain systems and smart contracts
        are public software utilities that are accessible directly through any
        compatible third-party node or indirectly through any compatible
        third-party <span className="text-primary">“wallet”</span> application
        that interacts with such a node. Interacting with the Protocol does not
        require the use of the Interface, but the Interface is only a convenient
        and user-friendly option of reading and displaying data from the
        Protocol and generating standard draft transaction messages compatible
        with the Protocol. The User may choose to interact with the Protocol
        using softwares other than the Interface. As the Interface does not
        provide wallet software applications or nodes for blockchain systems,
        such software constitutes an essential third-party software and user
        dependency without which the Protocol cannot be used and tokens cannot
        be traded or used. Furthermore, the Interface may use APIs and servers
        of Interface maintainers or third parties and there are no guarantees as
        to the continued operation, maintenance, availability, or security of
        any of the foregoing dependencies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5 className="text-primary">15.5 Tax Issues</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        The tax consequences of purchasing, selling, holding, transferring, or
        locking tokens or otherwise utilizing the Protocol are uncertain and may
        vary by jurisdiction. Interface Maintainers have undertaken no due
        diligence or investigation into such tax consequences, and assume no
        obligation or liability to optimize, facilitate or bear the tax
        consequences to any person.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5 className="text-primary">15.6 Legal Limitations on Disclaimers</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, or
        the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities, and damages.
        Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and limitations set forth in these
        Terms may not apply in full to specific Users. The disclaimers and
        limitations of liability provided in these terms shall apply to the
        fullest extent as permitted by applicable law.

      <br />
      <h5 className="text-primary">15.7 Indemnification</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        Each User shall defend, indemnify, compensate, reimburse and hold
        harmless the Interface maintainers from any claim, demand, action,
        damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable
        attorneys’ fees, arising out or relating to (a) User&apos;s use of, or
