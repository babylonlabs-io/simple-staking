        <p>
          Babylon is a suite of security-sharing protocols that bring Bitcoin\â€™s
          unparalleled security to the decentralized world. The latest protocol,
          Bitcoin Staking, enables Bitcoin holders to stake their Bitcoin to
          provide crypto-economic security to PoS (proof-of-stake) systems in a
          trustless and self-custodial way.

          <p>
            {coinName} holders lock their {coinName} using the trustless and
            self-custodial Bitcoin Staking script for a predetermined time
            (timelock) in exchange for voting power in an underlying PoS
            protocol. In return, Bitcoin holders will earn PoS staking rewards.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Finality providers perform the voting. A {coinName} staker can
            create a finality provider by itself and self-delegate or delegate
            its voting power to a third-party finality provider.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If a finality provider attacks the PoS system, the {coinName}s
            behind the voting powers delegated to it will be subject to protocol
            slashing. This deters ${coinName} stakers and finality providers
            from attacking the PoS system.

          The staking dApp is an interface to the Babylon Bitcoin Staking
          protocol. The Babylon Bitcoin Staking protocol allows ${coinName}{" "}
          holders to stake their ${coinName} and delegate their voting power to
          a finality provider they select. Stakers can view their past staking
          history and send a request to unlock their stake for early withdrawal.

        <p>
          Technically, your {coinName} has not left your custody. However, your
          wallet will not show the ${coinName} you staked in your available
          balance once that ${coinName} is locked. Current wallet
          implementations do not yet know how to display staked ${coinName} that
          is still in your custody. When staking, you do not send the $
          {coinName} to a third party. It is locked in a self-custodial Bitcoin
          Staking script that you control. This means that any subsequent
          movement of the ${coinName} will need your approval. You are the only
          one who can unbond the stake and withdraw.

          No, this should be avoided. Please do not connect or use a Bitcoin
          wallet holding BRC-20, ARC-20, Runes, or other NFTs or Bitcoin-native
          assets (other than ${coinName}). They are still in their infancy and

          tokens to avoid their misspending may not work, and you may lose all
          such tokens.
